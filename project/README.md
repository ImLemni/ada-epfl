# Is the book better than the movie?

# Abstract

Today, many Intellectual Properties are declined into multiple supports. For example, books are turned
into movies, series, theater plays, video games, and so on. Each platform has its own specificities
and their audience may have different expectations.
Our goal is to study the distribution of franchises across multiple platforms, especially movies and
books.
We intend to use the Amazon products dataset. The reviews will help us to derive interest for a product.
We are also able to study the link between the products bought by the same customer. This lets know
if 
Finally, we expect to study time patterns and interactions between the releases on different platforms
and customer behavior.


# Research questions

- Are the reviews better for movie or the book?
- What are the factors of success for each platform (ex. genre, ...)?
- Can we distinguish populations that prefer a certain form of medium?
- Are there people buying all the products for a license?
- Can we find interesting patterns when a release occurs on one platform?
- Can we find people buying the book after the release of a movie?
- Do the bad/good movie reviews mention the book?

# Dataset

We will use the [Amazon Product Data][amazon-data] dataset.
We will mainly use the "Books" and "Movies & TV" subsets.

We may also use other sources to help us with matching the books and movies (Wikipedia?).
